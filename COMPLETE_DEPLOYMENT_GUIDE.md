## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- **Persistent Data**: Uses `useKV` hooks for calculator inputs that persist between sessions
- **Temporary State**: Uses `useState` for UI state and calculations
- **No localStorage**: All persistence handled through Spark's KV store

### Styling System
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Custom Theme**: Professional blue/gray palette using oklch color space
- **Inter Font**: Google Fonts integration for professional typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

### Chart Visualizations
- **Recharts Library**: Modern React charts with tooltips and legends
- **Responsive Charts**: Adapt to container dimensions
- **Consistent Colors**: Match application theme
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Show detailed data on hover

### Calculator Algorithms
- **Compound Interest**: Proper formula with variable frequencies for both compounding and deposits
- **Time Value of Money**: Newton-Raphson methods for complex calculations
- **Amortization**: Complete payment breakdowns with principal/interest splits
- **Inflation**: Real vs. nominal value calculations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Blank Page After Deployment

**Potential Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Base Path Configuration**:
   - Verify `vite.config.ts` has correct base path: `/FREEDomCalculators/`
   - Check that repository name matches base path

2. **Build Issues**:
   - Check Actions tab for build errors
   - Verify all dependencies are properly installed
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds

3. **Asset Loading**:
   - Confirm images are in `src/assets/images/`
   - Verify asset imports use correct relative paths

4. **Browser Cache**:
   - Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
   - Try accessing in incognito/private mode

### Issue: GitHub Actions Failing

**Check These Items**:

1. **Repository Permissions**:
   - Settings > Actions > General
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected

2. **GitHub Pages**:
   - Settings > Pages
   - Verify "GitHub Actions" is selected as source

3. **Workflow File**:
   - Confirm `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists
   - Check workflow syntax and indentation

### Issue: Calculators Not Working

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Console Errors**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
   - Look for network errors in Network tab

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Test if inputs are saved between page refreshes
   - Verify useKV hooks are properly implemented

3. **Chart Issues**:
   - Ensure Recharts components have valid data
   - Check chart container dimensions
